# Math311_Linear_Algebra_Projects_JosephKnopp

This is a repository of projects for the Math 311 linear algebra course at Winona State University. It uses Google Colab and coding in Python to explore linear algebra concepts.

# Projects:

1. Solve Systems using Colab and Python

Using Google Co-Laboratory to introduce the idea of solving systems of equations with code:
